# This is the main Comprehension Agent file.
# This is where we first take the input from the user and verify we can outline:
# 1. A Plan of Execution
# 2. Preparation and Internal Handling
# 3. A Defined & Verifiable Outcome

# If the main Comprehension Agent cannot complete its task with the given information, it then returns what information
# it would need to complete the task from the user. Verifies once it receives that information, then checks against
# the existing plan of execution to see if an alternative approach is necessary.


# What GPT4 said about the above description:
# The detailed description for Comprehension effectively outlines its role as the system's initial point of interaction
# with user inputs. Highlighting the steps of planning, preparation, and defining a verifiable outcome sets a strong
# foundation for task execution. The mechanism for requesting additional information from the user if initial inputs are
# insufficient is crucial for ensuring tasks are understood & executed correctly. This proactive approach to clarifying
# and refining user inputs before proceeding underscores the system's adaptability and user-centric focus.
