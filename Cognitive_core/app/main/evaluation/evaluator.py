# This is the main Evaluator file.
# This is where output from Agents and Tasks are sent to.
# We create and destroy Evaluator Agents who determine the viability of each output it receives.
# If it thinks it successfully completed the task, inform the Orchestrator with the output.
# We then utilize the Orchestrator's stored main evaluation of if the task is completed.

# What GPT4 said about the above description:
# For the Evaluator, the concept of creating and destroying Evaluator Agents to assess the viability of outputs
# introduces a dynamic and scalable way to handle task verification. This modularity in evaluation ensures that
# resources are allocated efficiently and that each task's output is judged on its own merits. Informing the
# Orchestrator about successful completions connects the evaluation process back to the system's central control unit,
# facilitating a closed feedback loop that enhances task management and system learning.

class Evaluator:
    def __init__(self):
        # Initialize evaluation metrics and standards
        pass

    def evaluate(self, solution: dict) -> str:
        # Placeholder for evaluation logic
        evaluation_result = f"Task {solution['id']}, evaluated: {solution['result']}"
        return evaluation_result
