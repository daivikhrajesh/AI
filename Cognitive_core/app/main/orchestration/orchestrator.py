# What GPT4 said about the above description:
# The Orchestrator component's description as handling the creation of agents, semantic routing, and task delegation
# clearly establishes it as the system's operational core. This module's role in managing the flow of tasks and ensuring
# they are appropriately assigned and equipped underscores its critical function in maintaining the system's efficiency
# and coherence.

class Orchestrator:
    def __init__(self):
        # Initialize task management and routing logic
        pass

    def delegate_task(self, structured_input: dict) -> dict:
        # Placeholder for task delegation logic
        task = {"id": 123, "status": "delegated", "data": structured_input}
        return task
